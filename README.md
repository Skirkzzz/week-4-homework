# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## High Scores Repository

This repository contains the code for HTML, CSS and Javascript and creates a multiple choice quiz. The application, presents the user with a series of multiple choice questions for the user to answer.

There are two javascript files, one containing the questions for the coding quiz and the other enabling the interactions between the HTML files and the questions.

The code links HTML to javascript using the html 'id' tag to the javascript function get element by ID. The application has a timer, that uses the javascript 'set interval function' and 'if'/'else' statements, which time the user during the quiz.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Mock-Up
